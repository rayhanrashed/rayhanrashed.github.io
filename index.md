<h2 class="responsive-heading">Social Computing √ó AI √ó Governance</h2>

I am a PhD student at the UMich working with [Farnaz Jahanbakhsh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/farnazj/). I build AI-powered social computing systems that give users control over their digital experiences‚Äîfrom personalized content moderation to focused browsing. When I encounter a problem, I love to design and code solutions (see [here](link), also [here](link)).

>**```How can we design and build systems that empower users to shape their digital experiences?```**

## Research

### Personalized Content Moderation Through AI

Platforms define harm universally and respond with suppression. What if users could define harm themselves? We built **DIY-MOD** (CHI 2026, under review) that transforms harmful elements within content instead of removing the entire post. This preserves information while respecting individual needs. DIY-MOD applies real-time, context-aware personalized transformations through optimized LLM/VLM pipelines.


Current work  further explores AI-powered user safety and autonomy online:

**Agentic AI for Online Safety:** How can autonomous systems protect users across the entire web, beyond specific platforms?

**On-Device Intelligence with WebGPU:** Can we democratize AI safety by eliminating cloud dependencies? I'm building hybrid architectures where sensitive processing happens locally while leveraging cloud models strategically‚Äîmaking personalized safety both private and affordable.

### Governance for User-Centered Platforms

I think systems alone don't create change, we also need regulatory frameworks that enable user agency. My **Consumer Moderation Rights** framework (FAccT 2026, in prep) connects user autonomy to existing consumer protection laws, providing actionable pathways for platform accountability.



### LLMs for Scaling Education

I believe LLMs' highest impact lies in democratizing quality education:

-- **Current:** In collaboration with UMich Physical Therapy, we built LLM systems that scale expert feedback for clinical documentation and learning (AAAI IAAI 2026, under review)

-- **Previous:** In 2023-24, I worked on developing one of the first LLM-based personalized tutoring systems with virtual tutors called KALEEM. ([demo](link))
