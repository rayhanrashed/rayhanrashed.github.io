<h2 class="responsive-heading">Social Computing √ó AI √ó Governance</h2>

Hi, I'm **Rayhan** ("Raye-haan"), a PhD student in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Social Computing** at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu), advised by [Farnaz Jahanbakhsh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/farnazj/).

I research and design social computing systems aimed at achieving ethical, pro-social outcomes aligned with user preferences and community values. I complement hands-on system design with rigorous mixed-method studies, driven by one overarching question:


> **_How can AI-powered civic technologies empower communities to shape their digital‚Äîand social‚Äîexperiences?_**

I explore several interconnected areas:

- **Personalized & Community-driven Moderation:**  
  Creating tools that empower communities, rather than platforms, to define and manage their own online experiences.

- **Policy & Governance in Social Computing:**  
  Designing AI systems that democratize decision-making, addressing risks of centralized control, biases, and echo chambers.

- **Ethics of the Attention Economy & Pro-Social Platforms:**  
  Challenging existing platform designs that prioritize user attention over community health and proposing viable alternatives aligned with meaningful interactions.

- **AI in Unconventional Contexts (Spiritual Computing):**  
  Exploring how AI can facilitate deeper, reflective, or spiritual digital experiences, challenging traditional notions of online communities.

Before joining Michigan, I was:

- **Lecturer** at the [CS Department](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) at [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), graduating with a GPA of 3.94 (2nd in class). My academic growth was shaped by [Dr. A.B.M. Alim Al Islam](https://sites.google.com/site/abmalimalislam/publications), my undergraduate advisor.

- **Research Engineer** at [Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA)](https://sdaia.gov.sa/), deploying large-scale human-centered AI solutions.
