# Research

My research integrates rigorous mixed-method studies with practical system-building, focusing on how AI-powered civic technologies can empower communities to shape their digital and social experiences.

## Current Research Areas

### Personalized & Community-driven Moderation

Online spaces are increasingly dominated by centralized content moderation approaches that fail to address diverse community needs. My research develops tools that empower users and communities—rather than centralized platforms—to define and manage their online experiences.

This work includes:
- Designing and evaluating personalized content filtering mechanisms that respect user agency
- Exploring how AI can support community-defined moderation standards
- Investigating how different stakeholders perceive fairness in moderation systems

### Policy & Governance in Social Computing

I'm interested in democratizing decision-making around content moderation and platform governance. This research stream examines:
- How platforms can implement more transparent governance models
- The tension between platform/corporate interests and community well-being
- Design interventions that reduce risks of centralized control, biases, and echo chambers

### Ethics of Attention Economy & Pro-Social Platforms

Current social media platforms are designed to maximize engagement, often at the expense of user well-being and social cohesion. My research in this area:
- Critiques existing attention economy designs 
- Develops alternatives that prioritize community well-being over engagement metrics
- Creates and evaluates scalable systems aligned with users' values rather than advertising metrics

### AI in Unconventional Contexts (Spiritual/Social Computing)

I'm exploring how AI and social computing might support deeper and more reflective experiences online. This emerging research direction investigates:
- How AI might facilitate more meaningful connections in digital spaces
- The role of technology in supporting spiritual and contemplative practices
- Expanding our understanding of what digital communities can be, who they serve, and how they function beyond commercial interests

## Previous Research

My previous work has examined technology in marginalized and underserved communities, with a focus on how technology adoption reflects and sometimes reinforces existing social dynamics:

### Healthcare Accessibility for Marginalized Communities

**[Dakter Bari (CSCW'21)](/content/papers/dakter_bari.pdf)**  
This project focused on extending healthcare systems to extremely impoverished people in Bangladesh. We designed, developed, and deployed an intermediary-based solution that bridges the gap between available healthcare services and marginalized populations without access to technology.

### Platform Economics and Social Inequality

**[Uber in Bangladesh (CSCW'21)](/content/papers/uber.pdf)**  
This study examined how ridesharing platforms operate in Global South contexts, revealing how the local adoption of technology-based sharing economies can amplify existing inequalities and disrupt prevailing social dynamics.

### Technology Resilience During Crisis

**[Technology Repair During COVID-19 (COMPASS'21)](/content/papers/pandemic_repair.pdf)**  
This work documented how repair and e-waste worker communities adapted to pandemic restrictions, and how end-users developed new repair practices when formal repair services became unavailable.
