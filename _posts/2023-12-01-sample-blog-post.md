# Welcome to My Blog

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate how your new blog system works. With the structure we've set up, you can easily write new blog posts by creating markdown files in the `_posts` directory.

## How to Create a New Blog Post

1. Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the naming format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md`
2. Add the front matter (the section at the top between `---` lines) with layout, title, date, and excerpt
3. Write your post content in markdown format
4. The post will automatically appear in your blog page

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- Lists (like this one)
- [Links](https://rayhan.io)
- Code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Images

You can include images from your media directory:

![Sample Image]({{ site.url }}/media/bb.jpg)

## Final Thoughts

This blog system gives you a clean separation between your main website content and blog posts. It makes your site more maintainable and gives you a dedicated space for sharing your thoughts and updates.
